\textbf{iOS Developer} at Bright (prev. BrightHR) \rdate{September 2019--}\\
\textit{Skills Used: Swift, Objective-C, VIPER, Testing, DevOps}

Worked in a cross functional team to develop features for the core BrightHR app
that provides absence management services to employees and managers. I worked
with a mixed Objective-C and Swift codebase following a VIPER-like architecture.

\medskip

\textit{Interesting Work:}

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Helped finish converting the codebase from Objective-C to Swift.

\item Developed a Siri integration that enables users to ask Siri about current absences.

\item Spearheaded an effort to break the app up into frameworks that can be
  reused in extensions and Bright's other apps. Taking an incremental approach
  and working closely with other team members, I was able to start the process
  with minimal disruption. This work has enabled the development of new features
  such as the Siri integration.

\end{itemize}
