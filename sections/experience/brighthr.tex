\textbf{iOS Developer}, BrightHR \rdate{September 2019--}\\
\textit{Skills Used: Swift, Objective-C, VIPER, Testing, DevOps}

Worked in a cross functional team to develop features for the core BrightHR app
that provides absence management services to employees and managers. I worked
with a (initially) mixed Objective-C and Swift codebase following a VIPER-like
architecture.

\textit{Interesting Challenges:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Siri integration

\item Project modularisation

\item Structured logging (maybe)

\end{itemize}
