\textbf{iOS Developer} at Bright (prev. BrightHR) \rdate{September 2019--}\\
\textit{Skills Used: Swift, Objective-C, VIPER, Testing, DevOps}

Worked in a cross functional team to develop features for the core BrightHR app
that provides absence management services to employees and managers. I worked
with an (initially) mixed Objective-C and Swift codebase following a VIPER-like
architecture.

\medskip

\textit{Interesting Challenges:}

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a Siri integration that enables users to ask Siri about current absences.

\item Modularised the app, breaking it up into frameworks that can be reused in
extensions and Bright's other apps. I took an incremental approach, working
closely with team members to minimise disruption. The project completed
successfully and has sped up the development of new features such as a Siri
integration.

\end{itemize}
