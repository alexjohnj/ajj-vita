\textbf{iOS Developer}, BrightHR \rdate{September 2019--}\\
\textit{Skills Used: Swift, Objective-C, VIPER, Testing, DevOps}

Worked in a cross functional team to develop features for the core BrightHR app
that provides absence management services to employees and managers. I worked
with an (initially) mixed Objective-C and Swift codebase following a VIPER-like
architecture.

\medskip

\textit{Interesting Challenges:}

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a Siri Shortcuts integration that enables users to ask Siri who
  on their team is absent.

\item Modularised the app, breaking it up into frameworks that can be reused in
  other apps and extensions. This required coordination with other developers on
  the team to avoid conflicts, breakages and to identify reusable components.

\end{itemize}
