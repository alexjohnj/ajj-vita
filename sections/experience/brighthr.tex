\textbf{iOS Developer} at Bright (prev. BrightHR) \rdate{September 2019--}\\
\textit{Skills Used: Swift, Flutter, VIPER, Azure DevOps}

Worked in a cross functional team to develop features for the core BrightHR app
that provides absence management services to employees and employers. The core
app was written in Swift using a VIPER like architecture. I also had the
opportunity to work on a set of cross-platform apps built with Flutter that
provide legal advice to employers.

\medskip

\textit{Interesting Work:}

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Improved the observability of the mobile app in production by setting up
  remote logging services and adding rich debugging information to the app's
  errors. This allowed the development team to rapidly identify the source of
  live bugs and in one instance directly helped stop the business from losing a
  client.

\item Improved the energy efficiency of Bright's location based clock-in service
  (\emph{blip!}) by eliminating the need for always on background location
  access. This not only addressed customer concerns about battery usage but also
  their privacy concerns and resulted in a reduction in service issues.

\item Worked on making the app accessible with VoiceOver and pushed for making
  accessibility a part of the company's software development process.

\end{itemize}
