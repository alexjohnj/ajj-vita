\textbf{Lead iOS Developer} at Apposing Ltd. \rdate{January 2018--August 2019}\\
\textit{Skills Used: Swift, Objective-C, git, Testing, RxSwift}

Led a small team of developers working on a variety of applications for clients
in the retail, financial and insurance telematics domains. I introduced new
architectural ideas and tools to the team that brought consistency to how the
business developed and deployed new applications.

\textit{Interesting Work:}

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}

\item Took over development of the redesigned \emph{Footasylum} retail app that
  was running behind schedule. While working closely with external API
  developers and product owners, I distributed work throughout the team to
  complete the project on time. Post-release, I worked with an external
  development team and a major global fashion brand to integrate an AR
  experience into the app.

\item Developed a driving telematics app for an insurance start-up that monitors
  a driver's road safety and suggests how they can improve. I built a telematics
  library using an Elm inspired architecture to model tracking state and
  side-effects. The architecture bought compile time checks around the possible
  states of the tracking library and made it easy to incorporate real-world data
  into automated tests.

\item Worked closely with designers to build the initial version of
  \emph{tickr}, an ethical investment app. A key challenge in the development of
  the app was a multi-step onboarding flow that users could leave and return to
  at any point. I used coordinators to break the flow into composable sub-flows
  that supported state restoration.
