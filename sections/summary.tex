\mhead{Summary}%
iOS Developer with 3 years of Swift experience and 5 years of open-source
Objective-C experience.
I have developed and deployed complex applications using coordinators, protocol
orientated and functional programming techniques to produce stable, testable and
maintainable products.

\smallskip

I'm a proponent of using Swift's type system to make invalid application states
unrepresentable and to prevent runtime bugs from being discovered by users.
