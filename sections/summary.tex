\mhead{Summary}%
I am a self taught iOS developer and have been using Objective-C since 2011 and
Swift since 2015. I have experience developing iOS and macOS apps as well as
open source Swift frameworks. I strive to write maintainable, testable and well
documented code having experienced the horrors of scientific code throughout my
degree.
