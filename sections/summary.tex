\mhead{Summary}%
Junior iOS Developer with 2 years of Swift experience and 5 years of open-source
Objective-C experience. I have developed apps using Core Data, networking and
concurrency that are highly testable and have a smooth user experience. I strive
to write maintainable, testable and well documented code having experienced the
horrors of scientific code at university.

Since graduating in 2017, I have been developing an app that synchronises
bookmarks with the Pinboard bookmarking service and provides a powerful
interface to manage a collection of bookmarks.
