\mhead{Summary}%
I am a Junior iOS Developer with 2 years of experience in Swift and 5 years of
open-source experience in Objective-C. I have developed apps that use Core Data,
networking and concurrency that are highly testable and have a smooth user
experience. I strive to write maintainable, testable and well documented code
having experienced the horrors of scientific code at university.

Since graduating in 2017, I have worked on an app that synchronises bookmarks
with the Pinboard bookmarking service and provides a powerful interface to
manage a collection of bookmarks.
