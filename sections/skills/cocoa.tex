\textbf{iOS Development}

I'm experienced working in \skill{Swift} and \skill{Objective-C} both
independently and in mixed codebases. I'm comfortable working with
object-orientated, protocol orientated and functional programming paradigms
while being pragmatic about applying them.

\smallskip

\textbf{Architecture}

I have experience developing testable applications using \skill{MVC},
\skill{MVVM} and \skill{VIPER}. I've also explored some exotic architectures
such as The Elm Architecture. I find TEA particularly interesting because it
simplifies testing and makes it easier to reason about data flow in an
application.

\smallskip

\textbf{Persistence}

I've worked extensively with \skill{Core Data} in a multi-threaded environment
and am aware of its strengths and weaknesses. I've also worked with
\skill{SQLite} using the excellent GRDB library.

\smallskip

\textbf{Tools}

I'm comfortable working with \skill{git} in a collaborative environment. I have
worked with \skill{fastlane} and Azure DevOps to develop a CI system and
automate app releases. I have experience distributing open source and internal
libraries using \skill{CocoaPods}, \skill{Carthage} and the Swift Package
Manager.
