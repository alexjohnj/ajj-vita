I have extensive experience working with Apple platforms and frameworks
including \skill{Cocoa}, \skill{Core Data} and \skill{Core Location}. I'm also
familiar with 3rd party frameworks including \skill{RxSwift} and \skill{GRDB}. I
have worked in codebases using \skill{MVC}, \skill{MVVM} and \skill{VIPER} with
a preference towards more functional, data-orientated patterns. 

TODO: Something something tuned into developments, working with Combine and SwiftUI.
