\textbf{iOS Development}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0mm]
\item Experienced working in \skill{Swift} (since Swift 2.0) and
  \skill{Objective-C} both independently and in mixed environments. I have a
  solid understanding of \skill{object orientated}, \skill{protocol orientated}
  and \skill{functional programming} paradigms and use them where appropriate.
\item Experienced designing application architecture with \skill{MVC} as well as
  variants like \skill{\mbox{MVC-C}} and \skill{\mbox{MVC-N}}. I also have some exposure to
  the \skill{MVVM} design pattern having used it in components of my app.
\item Have used NSURLSession to interact with \skill{RESTful web services} and
  designed a protocol orientated system to create network requests with type
  safety.
\item Extensive knowledge of \skill{Core Data}, its \skill{concurrency} model
  and efficiently importing data from web services. I have a good understanding
  of the performance characteristics of the Core Data stack, how to profile it
  using \skill{Instruments} and how to design models for fast, Unicode aware
  search predicates.
\item Experienced using \skill{XCTest} to build \skill{unit tests} and
  \skill{performance tests} for asynchronous code that involves networking and
  persistence.
\item Experienced with a variety of iOS development tools. I'm comfortable with
  \skill{Xcode} and \skill{AppCode} which I prefer for its stability and vim
  mode. I've used workspaces to manage multi-target projects and build schemes
  to create testing versions of apps. I've used \skill{Carthage} and
  \skill{CocoaPods} to manage dependencies and distributed open source libraries
  using Carthage.
