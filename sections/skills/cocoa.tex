\textbf{iOS Development}

I'm experienced working in \skill{Swift} and \skill{Objective-C} both
independently and in mixed codebases. I'm comfortable working with
object-orientated, \skill{protocol orientated} and functional programming
paradigms and I'm pragmatic about applying them.

\smallskip

\textbf{Architecture}

I have experience designing testable applications using \skill{MVC} and
\skill{MVVM} and have explored some more exotic architectures such as RIB and
The Elm Architecture. I find TEA particularly interesting because it makes
testing easy without having to introduce an army of test doubles.

\smallskip

\textbf{Persistence}

I've worked extensively with \skill{Core Data} in a multi-threaded environment
and am aware of its strengths and weaknesses. I've also had some exposure to
Realm when maintaining a legacy application. Recently I've been working with
\skill{SQLite} using the GRDB framework which has grown to be one of my
favourite open source frameworks because of its design and extensive
documentation.

\textbf{Tools}

I'm comfortable working with \skill{git} in a collaborative environment. I have
used \skill{fastlane} to automate application releases and reduce code signing
headaches. I have experience distributing open source libraries using
\skill{CocoaPods}, \skill{Carthage} and the Swift Package Manager.
