\textbf{iOS Development}\\
I have experience of developing an app that talks to a third-party
\skill{RESTful web service}, persists the data using \skill{Core Data}, and
synchronises changes with the web service. This has given me experience with
Core Data's \skill{concurrency} model and too much exposure to debugging race
conditions. I'm experienced with using the \skill{MVC} design pattern as well as
variants like MVC-N to separate networking and persistence from view
controllers. I also have some exposure to alternative patterns such as MVVM. I
have experience with \skill{unit testing} using \skill{XCTest} including testing
asynchronous networking and persistence methods.
