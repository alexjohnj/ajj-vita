\textbf{iOS Development}\\
I have experience of developing an app that talks to a third-party
\skill{RESTful web service}, persists the data using \skill{Core Data}, and
synchronises changes with the remote service. This has given me experience using
Core Data in a concurrent environment and too much exposure to debugging race
conditions. I'm experienced with using the \skill{MVC} design pattern as well as
variants like MVC-N to separate networking and persistence from view
controllers. I also have some exposure to alternative patterns such as MVVM and
VIPER. I have experience of \skill{unit testing} with \skill{XCTest}. In recent
projects, I have made extensive use of dependency injection and protocols to
enable unit testing of networking and persistence code.
