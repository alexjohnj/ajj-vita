\textbf{Swift}

I have followed the development of \skill{Swift} since its announcement and have
been using Swift in applications since Swift 2.0. I have fully embraced the
multi-paradigm nature of Swift in my code using protocol-orientated and
functional programming patterns where appropriate. I have experience of using
Swift in a mixed \skill{Objective-C} and Swift environment and converting
Objective-C code to Swift.
