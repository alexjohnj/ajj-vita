\textbf{Other Skills}\\
I have used \skill{Git} extensively for personal projects and have some exposure
to using Git in projects with multiple contributors. I have experimented with a
variety of programming languages outside of my core skill set including Julia,
Haskell and Emacs Lisp. From my degree I have been exposed to MATLAB and gained
experience in scientific \skill{Python} programming, data wrangling and
compiling undocumented scientific code written long before I was born.
