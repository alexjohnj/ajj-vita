\textbf{Other Development Skills}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0mm]
\item Building macOS applications using AppKit.
\item Using \skill{Git} for version control and collaboration.
\item Writing scripts, scientific programs and packages using \skill{Python}.
\item Lots of exposure to languages used outside of the iOS ecosystem including
  Julia, \mbox{MATLAB}, Go and Haskell with open source projects in some of
  them. I like learning new languages to see what ideas from them can be
  incorporated into my day-to-day work.
