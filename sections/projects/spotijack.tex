\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0mm]
\item A macOS application that records music from Spotify using Audio Hijack
  Pro's AppleScript interface and the ScriptingBridge framework.
\item Ported from Objective-C to Swift using Swift's interoperability features
  to work with the highly dynamic ScriptingBridge framework.
\item Developed unit tests by writing mocks for Spotify and Audio Hijack Pro's
  interfaces. This helped identify and fix several bugs in the original
  Objective-C application and ensured the app could not enter an inconsistent
  state.
