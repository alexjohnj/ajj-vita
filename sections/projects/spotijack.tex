A macOS application that records music from Spotify using Audio Hijack Pro and
the ScriptingBridge framework. Originally written in Objective-C, I ported the
app to Swift using Swift's interoperability features to work with the highly
dynamic ScriptingBridge framework. The project includes unit tests that mock the
dependency on running applications to ensure the app could not enter an
inconsistent state.
