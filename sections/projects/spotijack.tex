A macOS utility that records music from Spotify using its AppleScript interface
and Audio Hijack Pro. Originally written in AppleScript, the app was rewritten
in Objective-C and later Swift using the ScriptingBridge framework.

The app is highly stateful and must keep its state in sync with two external
applications. By abstracting the interfaces to the external apps into protocols,
I was able to write automated tests against mock objects to ensure that the app
could not enter an inconsistent state.
