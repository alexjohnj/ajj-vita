A macOS application that records individual songs from Spotify. Originally
written in \mbox{Objective-C} and dependent on Audio Hijack Pro to record audio,
Spotijack now handles recording independently. The project has led to
explorations of real time audio programming and audio driver development for
macOS\@.
