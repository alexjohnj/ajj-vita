An iOS client for the Pinboard bookmarking service under active development. The
application maintains an offline copy of a user's bookmarks that it keeps
synchronised with Pinboard using the web API.

The networking and persistence layers of the app are designed to operate
asynchronously to avoid blocking the user interface. I use a combination of
operation queues and dispatch groups to manage concurrency and designed the
systems with a callback based API. This is creating some maintenance issues so I
am exploring an alternative way of managing asynchrony with promises.
