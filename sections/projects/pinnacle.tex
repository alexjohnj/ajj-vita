\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0mm]
\item An iOS client for the Pinboard bookmarking service under active
  development. It provides a powerful interface for users to read and organise
  their collection of bookmarks on iPhone and iPad.
\item Adopted the coordinator pattern for the application's architecture which
  reduced the complexity of view controllers and improved their testability
  while augmenting the standard design patterns of UIKit rather than working
  against them.
\item Used concurrent networking and persistence APIs throughout the app to
  maintain an uninterrupted user experience. Asynchronous APIs are managed using
  promises to improve code readability.
\item Separated the sync, networking and model code into separate frameworks to
  ensure that separation of concerns is achieved and to increase code
  reuse. This made the code highly testable.
\item Implemented persistence using Core Data, designing a Unicode aware model
  for efficient fetch requests.
\item Implemented a sync system that can import tens of thousands of bookmarks
  from JSON data within reasonable time and memory constraints.
\item Developed automated performance tests for the sync system to monitor for
  performance regressions and identify targets for optimisation.
\item Developed a protocol orientated system for managing network requests.
