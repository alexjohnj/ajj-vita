An iOS client for the Pinboard bookmarking service under active development. The
application maintains an offline copy of a user's bookmarks that it keeps
synchronised with Pinboard using the web API.

As the Pinboard API can be slow and the synchronisation system has to handle
tens of thousands of bookmarks, I had to design the app's internals with
concurrency in mind. Ultimately I used a combination of operation queues and
dispatch groups to managed concurrency in the network and persistence layers of
the app.
