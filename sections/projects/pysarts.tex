A Python command line utility that processes satellite radar images and weather
data. Built as a part of my dissertation, the CLI provides access to an
algorithm I developed that uses weather models and weather radar images to
correct errors in satellite radar images.

The data processed is too large to fit into memory so I used memory mapping to
reduce memory pressure and parallel processing to speed up the correction
algorithm.
