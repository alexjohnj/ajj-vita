\mhead{Skills}%
I'm experienced working in both \skill{Swift} and \skill{Objective-C}.
%
I've worked extensively with Apple's platforms and frameworks including
\skill{Cocoa}, \skill{UIKit}, \skill{Core Data} and \skill{Combine}.
%
I've worked with teams using architectures that include \skill{MVC},
\skill{MVVM} and \skill{VIPER}.

\smallskip

Outside of Apple's platforms, I've worked on cross-platform apps built using
\skill{Flutter} and am familiar with \skill{C} and \skill{Python}.
